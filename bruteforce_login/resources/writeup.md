## Bruteforce attack with a dictionary

This vulnerability is on the signin page: http://localhost:8080/index.php?page=signin.

How to defend : password policy, non-simple passwords

intuition is last flag is probably signin page
let's try and bruteforce the password
installed hydra locally

```

not very secure hm, using any user with shadow as password leads to : "The flag is : b3a6e43ddf8b4bbb4125e5e7d23040433827759d4de1c04ea63907479a80a6b2 " !
